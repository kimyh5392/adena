("Onbloc", the "Company", "we", "us" or "our") is a blockchain development company focused on utilizing decentralized technologies such as the Gnoland blockchain. Onbloc hosts a top level domain website, https://adena.app/, that provides information regarding Onbloc’s product, Adena Wallet (“Adena”) and its service offerings, as well as sub-domains for Onbloc's product offerings (collectively, the "Site"), which includes text, images, audio, code and other materials and third party information.<br><br>
                        Onbloc makes available to certain users certain software services, including Onbloc's unhosted wallet application and browser extension (the "Wallet" or the "App"). The Wallet enables users to (i) store locally on their own devices, tokens, cryptocurrencies and other crypto or blockchain-based digital assets (collectively, "Digital Assets"); (ii) link to decentralized applications, including, without limitation, decentralized exchanges (collectively "Dapp(s)"); (iii) view addresses and information that are part of digital asset networks and broadcast transactions; and (iv) additional functionality as may be added to the App from time to time (collectively the "Services").<br><br>
                        These Terms of Service (these "Terms" or this "Agreement") (i) contain the terms and conditions that govern your access to and use of the Site and Services and (ii) constitute a legally binding agreement between us and you and/or the entity you represent ("you", "your" or "user").<br><br>

                    <p>
                        We may modify the Terms at any time at our sole discretion. If we do so, we'll notify you either by posting the modified Terms on the Site, by providing you a notice through the App, or through other methods of communication which we deem reasonable. It's important that you review the Terms whenever we modify them, because, if you continue to use the Site or Services after we have modified the Terms, you are agreeing to be legally bound, and to abide, by the modified Terms.<br><br>
                        If you don't agree to be bound by the modified Terms, then you may not use the Site or Services. Because our Services are evolving over time we may change or discontinue all or any part of the Site or Services, at any time and without notice, in our sole and absolute discretion.<br><br>When you use our Site and/or Services, you may also be using the services of one or more third parties. For example, obtaining the Adena Wallet browser extension requires access to the Google Chrome webstore. Your use of those and other third-party services ("Third-Party Services") will be subject to the privacy policies, terms of use and similar policies and terms, and fees of those third party services.

                        By accessing and using the Services, you represent that you understand the inherent risks associated with using cryptographic and blockchain-based systems, and that you have a working knowledge of the usage and intricacies of Digital Assets. You further understand that the markets for these Digital Assets are highly volatile due to factors including (but not limited to) adoption, speculation, technology, security, and regulation. You acknowledge and accept that the cost and speed of transacting with cryptographic and blockchain-based systems such as Gnoland are variable and may increase dramatically at any time. You further acknowledge and accept the risk that your Digital Assets, or any Digital Assets you acquire, may lose some or all of their value and you may suffer loss due to the fluctuation of prices of tokens and/or significant price slippage and cost. You understand that anyone can create a token, including fake versions of existing tokens and tokens that falsely claim to represent projects, and acknowledge and accept the risk that you may mistakenly trade those or other tokens. You further acknowledge that we are not responsible for any of these variables or risks and that we cannot be held liable for any resulting losses that you experience while accessing or using the Site or Services.<br><br>
                        The Services and your Digital Assets could be impacted by one or more regulatory inquiries or regulatory actions, which could impede or limit the ability of Onbloc to continue to make its proprietary software, and thus, could impede or limit your ability to continue to use the Services.<br><br>
                        You understand and acknowledge that cryptography is a progressing field with advances in code cracking and other technical advancements, such as the development of quantum computers, which may present risks to Digital Assets and the services, and could result in the theft or loss of your Digital Assets. To the extent possible, we intend to update Onbloc-developed smart contracts related to the Services to account for any advances in cryptography and to incorporate additional security measures necessary to address risks presented from technological advancements, but that intention does not reflect a binding commitment and does not in any way guarantee or otherwise ensure full security of the Services.<br><br>
                        You understand that the Gnoland blockchain (and all other networks with which the Services may be compatible) remains under development, which creates technological and security risks when using the Services in addition to uncertainty relating to Digital Assets and transactions therein. You acknowledge that the cost of transacting on the Gnoland blockchain is variable and may increase at any time, thereby impacting any activities taking place on the Gnoland blockchain, which may result in price fluctuations or increased prices for using the Services.<br><br>
                        You acknowledge that the Services are subject to flaws and that you are solely responsible for evaluating any code provided by the Site or Services. This warning and others Onbloc provides in these Terms in no way evidence or represent any on-going duty to alert you of the potential risks of utilizing the Services or accessing the Site.<br><br>
                        Although we intend to provide accurate and timely information on the Site and during your use of the Services, that intention does not reflect a binding commitment, and the Site and other information available when using the Services may not be accurate, complete, error-free or current. To continue to provide you with as complete and accurate information as possible, information may be changed or updated from time to time without notice, including, without limitation, information regarding our policies. Accordingly, you should verify all information before relying on it in any manner, and all decisions based on such information contained on the Site or made available through the Services are your sole and absolute responsibility. No representation of any kind or nature is made as to the accuracy, completeness or appropriateness for any particular purpose of any pricing or other information distributed via the Site or Services. Pricing information may be higher or lower than prices available on platforms providing similar services.<br><br>
                        Any reference to a type of Digital Asset on the Site or otherwise during the use of the Services does not indicate our approval or disapproval of the technology on which the Digital Asset relies, and should not be used as a substitute for your understanding of the risks specific to each type of Digital Asset.<br><br>
                        Use of the Services, in particular for trading Digital Assets, may carry financial risk. Digital Assets are, by their nature, highly experimental, risky, and volatile. Transactions entered into in connection with the Services are irreversible, final and there are no refunds. You acknowledge and agree that you will access and use the Site and the Services at your own risk. The risk of loss in trading Digital Assets can be substantial. You should, therefore, carefully consider whether such trading is suitable for you in light of your circumstances and financial resources. By using the Services, you represent and warrant that you have been, are, and will be solely responsible for making your independent appraisal and investigations into the risks of a given transaction and the underlying Digital Assets. You represent that you have sufficient knowledge, market sophistication, professional advice, and experience to make your evaluation of the merits and risks of any transaction conducted in connection with the Services or any Digital Asset. You accept all consequences of using the Services, including the risk that you may lose access to your Digital Assets indefinitely. All transaction decisions are made solely by you. Notwithstanding anything in these Terms, we accept no responsibility whatsoever for, and will in no circumstances be liable to you in connection with, your use of the Services for performing Digital Asset transactions.<br><br>

                        These Terms shall be construed and enforced in accordance with the laws of the Republic of Korea applicable to contracts entered into and performed in the Republic of Korea by residents thereof; provided that all provisions hereof related to arbitration shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the Korean Arbitration Act.

                    <br>
                    <p>
                        PLEASE READ THIS "MANDATORY ARBITRATION" PROVISION VERY CAREFULLY. IT LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN YOU AND ONBLOC, SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND OPT-OUT OPTION SET FORTH BELOW.<br><br>
                        You and Onbloc agree that any and all past, present and future disputes, claims, or causes of action arising out of or relating to your use of any of the Site or the Services, this Agreement, or any other controversies or disputes between you and Onbloc (including, without limitation, disputes regarding the effectiveness, scope, validity or enforceability of this agreement to arbitrate) (collectively, "Dispute(s)"), shall be determined by arbitration, unless (A) your Country of Residence does not allow this arbitration agreement; (B) you opt out as provided below; or (C) your Dispute is subject to an exception to this agreement to arbitrate set forth below. You and Onbloc further agree that any arbitration pursuant to this Section shall not proceed as a class, group or representative action. The award of the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction.<br><br>
                        "Country of Residence" for purposes of this agreement to arbitrate means the country in which you hold citizenship or legal permanent residence, as well as any country from which you regularly access and use the Onbloc Services. If more than one country meets that definition for you, then your country of citizenship or legal permanent residence shall be your Country of Residence, and if you have more than one country of citizenship or legal permanent residence, it shall be the country with which you most closely are associated by permanent or most frequent residence.<br><br>
                        If you do not wish to be subject to this agreement to arbitrate, you may opt out of this arbitration provision by sending a written notice to Onbloc at info@adena.app within thirty (30) days of first accepting this Agreement. You must date the written notice, and include your first and last name, address, and a clear statement that you do not wish to resolve disputes with Onbloc through arbitration. If no written notice is submitted by the 30-day deadline, you will be deemed to have knowingly and intentionally waived your right to litigate any Dispute except with regard to the exceptions set forth below. By opting out of the agreement to arbitrate, you will not be precluded from using the Onbloc Service, but you and Onbloc will not permitted to invoke the mutual agreement to arbitrate to resolve Disputes under the terms otherwise provided herein.<br><br>
                        You and Onbloc agree that the arbitration of any Dispute shall proceed on an individual basis, and neither you nor Onbloc may bring a claim as a part of a class, group, collective, coordinated, consolidated or mass arbitration (each, a "Collective Arbitration"). Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, a claim to resolve any Dispute against Onbloc will be deemed a Collective Arbitration if (i) two (2) or more similar claims for arbitration are filed concurrently by or on behalf of one or more claimants; and (ii) counsel for the claimants are the same, share fees or coordinate across the arbitrations. "Concurrently" for purposes of this provision means that both arbitrations are pending (filed but not yet resolved) at the same time.<br><br>
                        TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, NEITHER YOU NOR ONBLOC SHALL BE ENTITLED TO CONSOLIDATE, JOIN OR COORDINATE DISPUTES BY OR AGAINST OTHER INDIVIDUALS OR ENTITIES, OR ARBITRATE OR LITIGATE ANY DISPUTE IN A REPRESENTATIVE CAPACITY, INCLUDING AS A REPRESENTATIVE MEMBER OF A CLASS OR IN A PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL CAPACITY. IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISPUTE (AS DEFINED ABOVE), ANY AND ALL SUCH RIGHTS ARE HEREBY EXPRESSLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVED. Without limiting the foregoing, any challenge to the validity of this paragraph shall be determined exclusively by the arbitrator.<br><br>
                        Notwithstanding your and Onbloc's agreement to arbitrate Disputes, either you or Onbloc retain the following rights:<br><br>
                        You and Onbloc retain the right (A) to bring an individual action in small claims process in the courts of your Country of Residence; and (B) to seek provisional relief in aid of arbitration in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party's copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. Further, this agreement to arbitrate does not deprive you of the protection of the mandatory provisions of the consumer protection laws in your Country of Residence; you shall retain any such rights and this agreement to arbitrate shall be construed accordingly.<br><br>
                        Except as otherwise required by applicable law or provided in this Agreement, in the event that the agreement to arbitrate is found not to apply to you or your Dispute, you and Onbloc agree that any judicial proceeding may only be brought in a court of competent jurisdiction in the Republic of Korea. Both you and Onbloc consent to venue and personal jurisdiction there; provided that either party may seek provisional relief in aid of arbitration to enforce its intellectual property rights as provided above or bring an action to confirm an arbitral award in any court having jurisdiction.<br><br>
                        This agreement to arbitrate shall survive the termination or expiration of this Agreement. With the exception of the provisions of this agreement to arbitrate that prohibit Collective Arbitration, if a court decides that any part of this agreement to arbitrate is invalid or unenforceable, then the remaining portions of this agreement to arbitrate shall nevertheless remain valid and in force. In the event that a court finds the prohibition of Collective Arbitration to be invalid or unenforceable, then the entirety of this agreement to arbitrate shall be deemed void (but no provisions of this Agreement unrelated to arbitration shall be void), and any remaining Dispute must be litigated in court pursuant to the preceding paragraph.

Except as provided above with respect to the provisions hereof pertaining to Collective Arbitration, if any provision of these Terms is held invalid or unenforceable (either by an arbitrator appointed as provided above or by a court of competent jurisdiction) that provision will be enforced to the maximum extent permissible and the other provisions of these Terms will remain in full force and effect. You may not assign or transfer these Terms, by operation of law or otherwise, without our prior written consent. Any attempt by you to assign or transfer these Terms without such consent will be null and void and of no force or effect. We may freely assign or transfer these Terms without restriction. Subject to the foregoing, these Terms will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.<br><br>
                        Any notices or other communications provided by us under these Terms, including those regarding modifications to these Terms, will be given by posting to the Services and/or through other electronic communication. You agree and consent to receive electronically all communications, agreements, documents, notices and disclosures that we provide in connection with your Account and/or your use of the Services.<br><br>
                        Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will not be considered a waiver of such right or provision. The waiver of any such right or provision will be effective only if in writing and signed by a duly authorized representative of Onbloc. Except as expressly set forth in these Terms, the exercise by either party of any of its remedies under these Terms will be without prejudice to its other remedies under these Terms or otherwise.<br><br>
                        These Terms are written in English (U.S.). Any translated version is provided solely for your convenience. To the extent any translated version of our Terms conflicts with the English version, the English version controls.
